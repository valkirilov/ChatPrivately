# Sketch.js

Sketch.js is an easy-to-use jQuery plugin that allows you to create canvases upon
 which visitors can draw. The code is partially inspired by <a href='http://www.williammalone.com/articles/create-html5-canvas-javascript-drawing-app/'>William Malone's drawing app tutorial</a> as well as <a href='http://canvaspaint.org'>CanvasPaint</a>.

## Installation

To use Sketch.js in your project, just grab the latest <a href='http://intridea.github.com/sketch.js/src/sketch.js'>sketch.js</a> 
from GitHub and include it in your project after jQuery.
